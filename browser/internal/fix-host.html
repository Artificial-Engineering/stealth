			<h3>Connect Error</h3>
			<p>
				The Stealth Browser could not connect to the
				server of the given URL. The following reasons
				are most likely why this happened:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>This machine has no internet access</li>
				<li>The host cache is corrupted and the server has new IP(s)</li>
				<li>The server is offline</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Fix Host Cache</h3>
			<p>
				This requires internet access. In order to make
				sure that the host cache is up-to-date, you can
				try to refresh the known host IP addresses here
				manually.
				<br><br>
				If they don't change, it's usually a sign that
				the server is offline or not reachable by its
				IP address.
